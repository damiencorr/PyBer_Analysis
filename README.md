# PyBer_Analysis

## CHALLENGE

### Challenge Overview

Three parts: 
- two additional technical analyses and 
- a written report that delivers your results to the CEO.
- Technical Analysis Deliverable 1: A DataFrame that summarizes the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type. -  **See PyBer.ipynb Jupyter Notebook**
- Technical Analysis Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week. -  **See PyBer.ipynb Jupyter Notebook**
- Delivering Results: A written report of your results, saved in a README.md document on your GitHub repository. - **See this README**

### Delivering Results
To deliver the results of your analysis, you will submit a written analysis created for your CEO, V. Isualize, in the form of a README.md file on your GitHub repository. In your README.md, you should have three paragraphs consisting of 4 to 5 sentences each.

The first paragraph should include the following:
- Describe the purpose, or the reason, you did this assignment.
- How did you analyze the data to create the technical deliverables?
- What can be said about the summary DataFrame and multiple-line graph with respect to the ride-sharing data among the different city types? 
  - Include images of the summary DataFrame table and the multiple-line graph in these results.
- A short summary of the results.

The second paragraph should include the following:
- What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? 
  - If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.
- Explain how you overcame any challenges or difficulties, and include what technical analysis you use to overcome the challenges or difficulties.

The third paragraph should include the following:
- Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
- Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
- What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?
